# Functional-and-Non-functional-Testing
In software engineering, testing is categorized into functional and non-functional types, which together ensure that an application works correctly and provides a high-quality user experience.
1. Functional Testing
Functional testing verifies what the system does. It focuses on the business requirements and specific features of the software. 
Objective: To validate that each function of the software operates in conformance with the requirement specifications.
Key Characteristics:
Typically follows "black-box" testing methods (inner code is not examined).
Results are often binary (Pass/Fail) based on expected behavior.
Commonly performed manually but can be automated.
Examples:
User Login: Checking if a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
Form Submission: Ensuring a registration form saves data correctly to the database.
Payment Processing: Verifying that a payment gateway correctly processes a transaction.
Types of Functional Testing:
Unit Testing: Testing individual components in isolation.
Integration Testing: Verifying that different modules work together correctly.
Regression Testing: Ensuring new changes haven't broken existing features.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Final check by users to see if the system meets their needs.
